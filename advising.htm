<h2>
Summer school</h2>
<ul>
				<li>
				<a href="http://www.usna.edu/Academics/Calendars-Events/Summer-School.php">Summer school web site</a></li>
				<li><strong>Voluntary summer school</strong> registration typically opens in MIDS 
				in late March (in 2020, it will open Monday, 6 April 2020 at 1700 ET), once all the summer assignments have been posted.&nbsp; Note: summer school slots typically fill up FAST; if you want to take a summer class, please jump onto the MIDS system as soon as the module opens. You can only sign up for a 
block when you have leave. You can only sign up for one summer school class per block, and you 
cannot have any other commitments during that block.</li>
				<li><strong>Course failure either fall or spring</strong> will almost certainly require you to take summer 
school in a &quot;voluntary&quot; status in place of leave.&nbsp; If you disagree with 
this definition of &quot;voluntary&quot;, think of it as your choosing not to devote 
enough effort to passing the course, and paying the consequences.&nbsp; If you do not want to give up leave, 
consider this early in the semester and do not fail a course.&nbsp; While there 
are exceptions that allow summer school in place of military training, they are 
truly rare and most of those mids are probably taking a second summer school 
during leave.</li>
				<li>For midshipmen pursuing a language minor, semester abroad, 
				med school, or other special cases, we can get &quot;voluntary with preference&quot; status 
				starting in 
				January.&nbsp; This will allow ProDev to consider your summer 
				school when assigning summer cruises, and gives you a higher 
				priority to actually getting the summer school course.</li>
				<li>In past years, PE201 (swimming for rising 3/c) and PE301 (swimming for 
				rising 2/c) has been able to be completed along with a voluntary summer 
				class. Look for an email from the PE department to the entire 
				brigade with the opportunity. Students volunteer to swim during 
				a portion of their lunch (typically Monday - Thursday). They can 
				drop at any point (thus to not interfere with summer classes). 
				This opportunity is available each block and the number of hours 
				in the pool depends on which swim class you take (PE201 or PE301).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pre-Preregistration</h2>
<ul>
	<li>For certain required courses (e.g. NL400, NL310, NN310, NE203, NN210) 
	the registrar will put the course into MIDS for those whose matrix shows 
	they are supposed to 
	take it that semester.&nbsp; These are hig demand courses that the 
	departments involved have problems accomodating many mids taking if for 
	convenience.&nbsp; There will be room for mids taking the course early for 
	VGEP or semester abroad.&nbsp; If you want to take the course out of sequence, 
	you will be competing first come-first served for any remaining slots.&nbsp; 
	If you want to delay the course for a good reason cleared by your academic 
	advisor, you can drop the course, and an opening will appear for someone who 
	wants to take the course early. &nbsp;This is required to keep the loadings relatively even between the two 
	semesters for the departments teaching these courses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Langugage Minors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete a minimum of six courses (18 credit hours) in any one language, to be taken in sequence. An average grade of B (3.0 GPA) or better must be earned in all courses in the language of specialization, unless permission is otherwise granted by the chair of Languages and Cultures.</li>
<li>Language validations prior to starting sequenced courses can alleviate a maximum of two courses (six credit hours) toward the minor. Validations in excess of six credit hours may fulfill graduation requirements but will not count toward the minor.</li>
<li>Language immersion programs (such as LSAP or STEM language-intensive summer programs) vetted by professors in the Languages and Cultures Department, semester study abroad, or CLS (Critical Language Scholarship program) may alleviate no more than two additional courses (six credit hours).
In all cases, a minimum of two language courses (six credit hours) must be taken in residence at USNA, with a 3.0 GPA.</li>
<li>Midshipmen who meet these requirements receive the minor automatically; there is no application procedure or designated adviser.</li>
<li> Info on language minors is at &nbsp;<a href="http://intranet.usna.edu/LanguagesAndCultures/Academics/Language-Minors.php">http://intranet.usna.edu/<wbr>LanguagesAndCultures/<wbr>Academics/Language-Minors.php</a>.&nbsp;

				(the more the better, probably at least two courses and four 
				would be better); we consider that prominently when we rank 
				our majors for IPO in the selection process.&nbsp; You might 
				want to do voluntary summer school, which must be before the 
				semester abroad, and is not possible 2/C summer for some programs which 
				start 
				in July or early August.&nbsp; You want to prioritize taking courses 
				early that you cannot get abroad, where the easiest courses to 
				get will be free electives, HUM/SS electives, and major 
				electives.</li>
				<li>If you want to do a 
				<a href="http://www.usna.edu/Academics/Special-Programs/SAEP.php">service academy exchange</a> (only&nbsp; 
				possible fall semester 2/C year), you should talk to both your advisor 
				and Prof. Barrett.&nbsp; The governing documents are 
				COMDTMIDNINST 1531.34 and COMDTMIDNNOTE 1531.34. The process 
				starts early in spring semester of 3/C year.</li>
				<li>If you are thinking about

				should talk to both your advisor and Prof. Barrett.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				This will require overloads or voluntary summer school, and some

<h2>Change of major</h2>
<ul>
	<li>See the senior academic advisor (SAA) of the major you want to change 
	into.</li>
	<li>If you determine the change will work, the SAA will show you how to fill 
	out the <a href="change_major_template.docx">form for the change of major.</a></li>
	<li>Get the required signatures (company officer, old major, new major) and 
	take to the dean's office.</li>
	<li>Change of major needs to be submitted prior to the end of final exams.</li>
	<li>A board will decide if you can switch, during the academic/advisory 
	boards, and you will be notified in early January.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<b>Section Changes&nbsp;</b>are restricted and require approval of the Chair of 
the department offering the course and the Academic Scheduler. Changes of 
section for convenience or to select, or avoid, a particular instructor are not 
allowed. Requests will be considered, but not guaranteed, if you are scheduled 
in a section with an instructor you had previously.
